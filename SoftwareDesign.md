# Software Design

This software is organized into two main components: a mathematics library and a graphical user interface (GUI).

---

### Math Library (MathLib)
This library is responsible for the implementation of the following operations:

- Gradient Calculator
- Divergence Calculator
- Curl Calculator

Each calculator takes a scalar or vector field as input and computes the result in 2D or 3D space.

---

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The GUI provides the front-end interface. It is responsible for:

- Input of scalar or vector fields
- Selection of the operation
- Visualization in 2D and 3D
- Interactive features such as zooming, rotating, and parameter adjustment

---

### Planned Extensions
- Step-by-step explanation mode for educational purposes
- Export functionality for visualizations and field data
